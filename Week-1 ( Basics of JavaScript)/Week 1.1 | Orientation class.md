### Suggested Commitment Levels Based on Experience

   - Basics in the first few classes, but it’ll get challenging by week 3.
   - Recommended to create small peer groups for collaborative learning.
   - Focus on building a solid foundation without worrying about advanced topics like bounties initially.
   - Post progress to stay accountable.

2. **Intermediate Level (15-20 hours/week)**:
   - For those with experience in other languages but new to the MERN stack.
   - The workload intensifies around week 7; aim to overcome the "beginner’s rut."
   - Focus on assignments, hard tasks, and gradually start contributing to GSoC from week 4.
   - Share your milestones on platforms like Twitter.

3. **Advanced Level / Cohort 1.0 Alumni (Minimal Hours Initially, then 15 hours/week)**:
   - Comfortable with MERN; suggested focus on GSoC contributions.
   - Skim through recorded classes as necessary; prioritize GSoC contributions.
   - Take up bounties if time allows, but GSoC preparation is the main goal.

### Actionable Steps to Get Started
1. **Join the Community on Discord** and form sub-groups for peer support.
2. **Set Up Access** on the course portal [100xDevs App](https://app.100xdevs.com/).
3. **Prepare your Development Environment**: Install an IDE, set up Node.js, and review HTML/CSS basics.
