## Why Language 

1. Languages are used to write applications
2. Developers write high level code in these languages
3. Every language has a **Complier** which converts the developer code into 01

In technical terms, a programming language is a formal set of instructions, rules, and syntax used to create software, applications, websites, and various technological solutions. It provides a structured way for programmers to communicate with computers, enabling them to write code that can be understood and executed by machines.

Key aspects of programming languages include:

1. **Syntax and Semantics:** Programming languages have specific rules (syntax) and meanings (semantics) governing how code should be written and interpreted. Syntax refers to the grammar and structure of the language, while semantics define the meaning and behavior of the code.

2. **Abstraction:** Languages offer different levels of abstraction, allowing programmers to work at varying degrees of complexity. Higher-level languages abstract away low-level details, making it easier to write code, while lower-level languages provide more control and direct interaction with hardware.

3. **Expressiveness:** Programming languages vary in their expressiveness, i.e., the ease with which complex operations or concepts can be conveyed and executed in code. Some languages are concise and allow for efficient code writing, while others prioritize readability and explicitness.

4. **Execution:** Once written, code in a programming language needs to be translated or compiled into machine-readable instructions that the computer's processor can understand and execute.

5. **Paradigms:** Programming languages often follow specific programming paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented, functional, or declarative approaches. These paradigms define the style and methodology used to solve problems and structure code.

6. **Tooling and Ecosystem:** Each programming language typically has its set of tools, libraries, and frameworks that assist developers in writing code efficiently and solving particular types of problems.

Programming languages serve as a bridge between human understanding and machine execution. They empower developers to create diverse software solutions by providing a standardized way to communicate instructions to computers, enabling the development of everything from simple scripts to complex applications and systems.

#### What is Complier 
A compiler is a specialized program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code or executable code that a computer can understand and execute directly.

- Step 1:- write code
- Step 2:- Complile code
- Step 3 :- Run the code (put it in ram)

#### What is Interprter
Interpreted languages are programming languages where the source code is directly executed line-by-line by an interpreter without the need for a separate compilation step. Instead of compiling the entire code into machine code before execution (as in compiled languages), an interpreter reads and executes the code statement by statement in real-time.

Certainly! Here's a comparison table highlighting some key differences between compiled and interpreted languages:

| Aspect                 | Compiled Languages                           | Interpreted Languages                         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|   -                     | First need to complie ,then need to run         | Usually go line by line   |
| -                      | Usually don't compile if there is an error in the code          | Can run partially if the error comes later     |
| **Execution Process**  | Entire source code is compiled into machine code before execution.         | Source code is read line-by-line and translated into machine code in real-time.         |
| **Output**             | Produces standalone executable files  or libraries.          | Does not produce standalone executable files; code executed through an interpreter.    |
| **Performance**        | Generally faster execution since code  is pre-compiled into machine code.      | May have slightly slower execution due to on-the-fly translation.   |
| **Portability**        | Executable files might be platform-specific and might require recompilation for  different systems. | More portable as the interpreter can run on various platforms without recompilation.   |
| **Debugging**          | Errors are often detected during compilation and may be easier to pinpoint. | Errors might be detected during runtime  and might be harder to pinpoint.     |
| **Development Speed**  | Longer compilation times,but potentially faster execution.                       | Shorter development cycles as changes in  code can be executed immediately.   |
| **Examples**           | C, C++, Rust, Go, Swift                     | Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, Perl        |
