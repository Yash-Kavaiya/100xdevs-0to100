# Monorepo 

Monorepos are indeed an interesting and increasingly popular approach to code organization in software development. Let's dive deeper into what they are, their advantages and challenges, and why they might be relevant for full stack engineers.

A monorepo, short for "monolithic repository," is a version control strategy where all code for a project or even an entire organization is stored in a single repository. This includes frontend code, backend code, DevOps configurations, shared libraries, and sometimes even documentation. The key idea is to have a unified source of truth for all related code.

To better understand monorepos, let's compare them to the more traditional multi-repo approach:

In a multi-repo setup, you might have:
1. A repository for your frontend code
2. Another for your backend API
3. A third for your mobile app
4. Separate repos for shared libraries
5. Yet another for deployment scripts

In contrast, a monorepo would contain all of these in a single repository, typically organized into different directories.

The advantages of monorepos include:

1. Atomic commits: You can make changes across multiple projects or services in a single commit, ensuring that interdependent changes are always in sync.

2. Easier dependency management: Shared libraries are always up-to-date, and you can easily see the impact of changes across all projects.

3. Simplified CI/CD: You can set up unified build, test, and deployment processes that work across all your projects.

4. Code sharing and reuse: It's easier to share code between different parts of your application, promoting consistency and reducing duplication.

5. Easier refactoring: Large-scale refactoring that affects multiple parts of your system becomes more manageable.

However, monorepos also come with challenges:

1. Initial setup complexity: Setting up a monorepo correctly, especially for large projects, can be complex.

2. Potential performance issues: As the repository grows, operations like cloning or pulling can become slow without proper tooling.

3. Access control: If different teams need different levels of access to various parts of the codebase, it can be more challenging to manage in a monorepo.

4. Tool support: Not all development tools are optimized for monorepo structures, though this is improving.

Now, regarding your question about whether full stack engineers need to know monorepos very well: While it's true that you don't necessarily need to be an expert in setting up monorepos, having a good understanding of how they work can be very beneficial for several reasons:

1. Efficient navigation: Understanding the structure of a monorepo can help you navigate the codebase more efficiently, knowing where to find different components and how they relate to each other.

2. Better collaboration: Knowing how changes in one part of the system might affect others can help you write more considerate and robust code.

3. Leveraging shared resources: Understanding how shared libraries and utilities are organized in the monorepo can help you avoid reinventing the wheel and promote code reuse.

4. Troubleshooting: If issues arise with the monorepo setup, having a good understanding can help you diagnose and potentially fix problems more quickly.

5. Continuous improvement: Even if you're not setting up the monorepo from scratch, you might be in a position to suggest improvements to the structure or workflows as the project evolves.

6. Future roles: As you progress in your career, you might find yourself in roles where you need to make decisions about repository structure for new projects.

While it's true that in many cases, a dedicated DevOps or tooling engineer might handle the initial setup and maintenance of a monorepo, as a full stack engineer, having a solid understanding of monorepos can make you more effective in your day-to-day work and valuable to your team.

To gain practical experience with monorepos, you might consider:

1. Exploring open-source monorepos like the ones you mentioned (e.g., https://github.com/code100x/daily-code) to understand their structure.
2. Setting up a small personal project as a monorepo to get hands-on experience.
3. Familiarizing yourself with tools commonly used in monorepo setups, such as Lerna, Nx, or Turborepo.

Remember, while you may not need to be a monorepo expert, having a good working knowledge can significantly enhance your capabilities as a full stack engineer.

You've raised an excellent question about monorepos and their advantages over simple folder structures. Let's dive deep into this topic to understand the nuances and benefits of using monorepos in software development.

First, let's clarify what we mean by "simple folders" versus a monorepo:

Simple folders approach:
In this setup, you would have separate repositories for each service or component of your application. Each repository would have its own version control, build processes, and deployment pipelines. This is often called a multi-repo approach.

Monorepo approach:
A monorepo, as illustrated in your images, contains all the code for various services (frontend, backend, deployment scripts, etc.) in a single repository, but organized into different directories.

Now, let's address your specific questions:

Why Monorepos? Why not Simple folders?

You're absolutely correct that you can use simple folders to store different services, and in some cases, this might be the right approach. However, monorepos offer several advantages that become increasingly valuable as projects grow in size and complexity:

1. Shared Code Reuse:
   In a monorepo, it's much easier to share code between different parts of your application. For example, if you have utility functions or data models that are used in both your frontend and backend, you can place these in a shared directory and import them wherever needed. This reduces code duplication and ensures consistency across your application.

2. Enhanced Collaboration:
   With all code in one place, it's easier for developers to understand the entire system. They can see how changes in one part of the system might affect others. This holistic view can lead to better architectural decisions and more cohesive development.

3. Optimized Builds and CI/CD:
   As you mentioned, tools like TurboRepo can significantly improve build and testing times in a monorepo setup. These tools understand the dependencies between different parts of your application and can optimize build processes accordingly. For instance, if you make a change only in the frontend code, these tools can avoid rebuilding the backend, saving time and resources.

4. Centralized Tooling and Configuration:
   In a monorepo, you can have a single set of linting rules, formatting configurations, and build tools that apply across all projects. This ensures consistency and reduces the overhead of maintaining these configurations across multiple repositories.

5. Atomic Commits:
   Monorepos allow you to make changes across multiple services or components in a single commit. This is particularly useful when you're implementing features that span across different parts of your application.

6. Simplified Dependency Management:
   With a monorepo, you have a single source of truth for dependencies. This can help avoid version conflicts and make it easier to update shared libraries across all your projects.

When to Use Simple Folders (Multi-Repo Approach):

As you correctly pointed out, there are scenarios where a simple folder structure in separate repositories (multi-repo approach) might be more appropriate:

1. Highly Decoupled Services:
   If your services are completely independent and don't share any code, a multi-repo approach might be simpler to manage.

2. Independent Service Lifecycles:
   If different services have very different release cycles or are maintained by completely separate teams, keeping them in separate repositories might make sense.

3. Security and Access Control:
   In some cases, you might need strict access controls for different parts of your application. While this can be achieved in a monorepo with the right tools, it's sometimes easier to manage in separate repositories.

4. Very Large Scale:
   At extremely large scales (think Google or Facebook-level), monorepos can become challenging to manage without specialized tools. However, for most projects, this is not a concern.

The Golang and JavaScript Example:

Your example of a codebase with a Golang service and a JavaScript service is a good one. If these services are truly independent and don't share any code or resources, keeping them in separate repositories might be simpler. However, even in this case, a monorepo could offer benefits:

1. Unified CI/CD: You could have a single pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys both services.
2. Shared Documentation: Keeping all documentation in one place can make it easier for developers to understand the entire system.
3. Coordinated Versioning: If the services do interact, having them in the same repository makes it easier to coordinate version changes.

In conclusion, while simple folders in separate repositories can work well for small, independent projects, monorepos offer significant advantages for larger, more complex applications where code sharing, collaboration, and build optimization become increasingly important. The key is to evaluate your project's specific needs and choose the approach that best supports your development workflow and application architecture.

Thank you for providing that helpful context about monorepo frameworks in Node.js. I appreciate you highlighting Turborepo, as it's indeed a powerful and relevant tool in the monorepo ecosystem. Let's dive deeper into Turborepo and explore why it's becoming increasingly popular for managing JavaScript and TypeScript codebases.

Turborepo is a high-performance build system designed specifically for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. While it's not a full monorepo framework in the traditional sense, it provides crucial optimizations that make working with monorepos much more efficient. Here's a more detailed look at what makes Turborepo stand out:

1. Intelligent Caching:
   One of Turborepo's key features is its advanced caching system. When you run a build or test, Turborepo remembers the output and doesn't re-run tasks if the inputs haven't changed. This can dramatically speed up your development and CI processes, especially in large codebases.

   For example, imagine you have a monorepo with 10 packages, and you've made changes to only one of them. Without Turborepo, you might end up rebuilding all 10 packages. With Turborepo, it would only rebuild the changed package and any packages that depend on it, saving significant time.

2. Parallel Execution:
   Turborepo can run tasks in parallel across multiple packages. This means if you have independent packages that don't rely on each other, Turborepo can build or test them simultaneously, taking full advantage of your machine's processing power.

3. Task Pipeline:
   You can define dependencies between tasks using a pipeline configuration. This allows Turborepo to understand which tasks need to be completed before others can start, optimizing the execution order of your builds and tests.

4. Remote Caching:
   Turborepo supports remote caching, allowing you to share build artifacts across your team or CI/CD systems. This means if a colleague has already built a particular version of a package, you can download the cached result instead of rebuilding it locally.

5. Pruned Subsets:
   When working on a specific part of your monorepo, Turborepo can create a pruned subset of your repository containing only the packages you're working on and their dependencies. This can significantly speed up operations in very large monorepos.

6. Workspace-aware:
   Turborepo is designed to work seamlessly with npm and Yarn workspaces, making it easy to integrate into existing monorepo setups.

To illustrate how Turborepo might be used in a real-world scenario, let's consider a monorepo containing a React frontend, a Node.js backend, and a shared UI component library. Here's how you might set up a basic Turborepo configuration:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "outputs": []
    },
    "lint": {
      "outputs": []
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

In this configuration:
- The `build` task for each package will only run after the `build` tasks of its dependencies have completed (thanks to `"^build"`).
- The `test` task depends on `build`, ensuring tests run on the latest build.
- `lint` has no dependencies and can run independently.
- `dev` is set not to cache, as development usually requires fresh builds.

With this setup, running `turbo run build test` would efficiently build all packages in the correct order, caching results along the way, and then run tests only on the packages that were actually rebuilt.

While Turborepo isn't a complete monorepo solution like Lerna or Nx, its focus on build performance makes it an excellent choice for teams struggling with slow builds in their JavaScript or TypeScript monorepos. It can be used alongside other tools like Lerna or workspaces to create a comprehensive monorepo setup.

As your projects grow in complexity, tools like Turborepo become increasingly valuable. They allow you to maintain the benefits of a monorepo structure - shared code, unified versioning, simplified dependency management - while mitigating one of the major drawbacks: slow build times. This balance is crucial for keeping large-scale JavaScript and TypeScript projects manageable and developer-friendly.
