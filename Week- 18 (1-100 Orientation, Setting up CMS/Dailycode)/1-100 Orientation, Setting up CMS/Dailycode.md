# 1-100 Orientation, Setting up CMS/Dailycode
Sure, here are the main points extracted from the image:

1. **0-1** is a great resource for knowing most things full stack, 1-100.
2. Jumping directly to **extra** is NOT recommended.
3. Projects in **1-100** will be implemented, writing code (mostly in Node).
4. **DevOps** part (K8s, monitoring) will probably be the most interesting bit.
5. There is **no pressure** to attend live.
6. You don't need **1-100** to start applying. You should have decent knowledge after **0-1** to start contributing.
7. Few good projects:
   - **DailyCode** â€“ [Link](https://github.com/code100x/daily-code)
   - **Sol Dispenser** â€“ [Link](https://github.com/code100x/github-sol-auto-dispenser)
   - **Decentralized Fiverr** â€“ [Link](https://github.com/code100x/decentralized-fiverr)
8. **Practice** matters much more at this point compared to learning new things.
