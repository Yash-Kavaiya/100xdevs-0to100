# 26.2 | Prometheus and Grafana
It sounds like you're facing challenges with New Relic, particularly regarding its cost, data ownership, and vendor lock-in. Here’s a breakdown of the concerns you mentioned:

1. **Cost**: New Relic is a paid service, and for some businesses, the costs can be significant, especially as their monitoring needs grow.

2. **Self-Hosting**: New Relic does not offer a self-hosted option, meaning all data and operations rely on their cloud infrastructure. This can be a drawback for organizations that prefer to maintain complete control over their data or have strict compliance requirements.

3. **Data Ownership**: Since New Relic is a SaaS product, they manage your monitoring data. This can raise concerns about data privacy, control, and ownership, especially for businesses that handle sensitive information.

4. **Vendor Lock-In**: Once New Relic is deeply integrated into your system, it can be challenging to transition to another monitoring solution. This is because significant time and resources are typically invested in configuring dashboards, alerts, and custom integrations.

### Potential Solutions and Alternatives

- **Open-Source Monitoring Tools**: Tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** provide robust monitoring and visualization capabilities and can be self-hosted. They offer flexibility and control over your data without the vendor lock-in associated with proprietary solutions.
  
- **Hybrid Approach**: Some businesses use a combination of tools to balance the benefits of different platforms. For example, you could use New Relic for certain high-priority applications while using open-source or other third-party tools for less critical monitoring.

- **Planning for Migration**: If you’re considering moving away from New Relic, start by identifying which components are most critical and where alternative solutions might be easily integrated. This approach can help mitigate the impact of a full migration.

Would you like more detailed advice on transitioning from New Relic or on setting up an alternative monitoring solution?

To set up Prometheus to scrape metrics from a Node.js application running on a Linux machine using Docker and Docker Compose, follow these steps:

### 1. **Setup Prometheus Configuration (`prometheus.yml`)**

You need to create a Prometheus configuration file that specifies how often Prometheus should scrape metrics and from which endpoints. Here’s the content of `prometheus.yml`:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s  # How frequently to scrape targets

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'nodejs-app'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['node-app:3000']
```

### 2. **Create a Dockerfile for Your Node.js Application**

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your Node.js application directory to containerize your app:

```dockerfile
# Use Node.js 20 as the base image
FROM node:20

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of your application code
COPY . .

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run your app
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

### 3. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` File**

This `docker-compose.yml` file will define two services: one for your Node.js app and another for Prometheus.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  node-app:
    build: ./
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    networks:
      - monitoring

  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    networks:
      - monitoring

networks:
  monitoring:
```

### 4. **Start Docker Compose**

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located. Then, run the following command to start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will build your Node.js application container, start it, and then start the Prometheus container using the specified configuration.

### 5. **Verify Prometheus is Running**

Once the services are up, you can verify that Prometheus is scraping the Node.js app by visiting [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) in your browser. 

1. Go to **Status > Targets** in the Prometheus UI to see if the Node.js app target (`node-app:3000`) is being scraped correctly.
   
2. You can also execute a query like `http_requests_total` (or whatever metrics your Node.js app exposes) in the **Graph** section of the Prometheus UI to visualize the data over time.

### **Troubleshooting**

- **Nothing running on port 3000**: Ensure your Node.js app is correctly set up to expose metrics on port 3000. In Docker, check that your app is running correctly inside its container. Logs can be viewed using `docker-compose logs node-app`.

- **Configuration Errors**: Make sure the `prometheus.yml` file is correctly mounted in the Prometheus container. This file should be in the root directory (or specified path) relative to your `docker-compose.yml` file.

- **Network Issues**: If Prometheus cannot reach the Node.js app, ensure both services are connected to the same Docker network (`monitoring` in this case).

Following these steps should set up Prometheus to scrape metrics from your Node.js application successfully. Let me know if there are any specific issues or if you need further assistance!
