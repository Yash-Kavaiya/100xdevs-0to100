## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as k8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. It is particularly useful for managing applications that are composed of multiple containers that need to communicate with each other.

#### Key Features of Kubernetes:
1. **Deployment**: Automates the deployment of containerized applications, ensuring they are distributed correctly across the cluster.
2. **Scaling**: Automatically scales applications up or down based on demand.
3. **Healing**: Automatically replaces or reschedules containers that fail, ensuring high availability.
4. **Configuration Management**: Manages application configuration separately from the code, enabling updates without redeploying the entire application.
5. **Resource Optimization**: Efficiently uses resources, ensuring that containers are running on the most suitable nodes.
6. **Monitoring and Logging**: Provides insights into the health and performance of applications through integrated monitoring and logging.

### Diagram Explanation

The diagram depicts a Kubernetes cluster running on three AWS machines, each hosting different containers:

1. **AWS Machine 1**:
   - **BE container 1**: A backend container.
   - **BE container 3**: Another backend container.
   
2. **AWS Machine 2**:
   - **BE container 2**: A backend container.
   
3. **AWS Machine 3**:
   - **FE container 1**: A frontend container.

### Benefits of Using Kubernetes:
1. **Automated Deployment and Scaling**: You can easily deploy and scale your applications without manual intervention.
2. **Self-Healing**: Kubernetes automatically restarts failed containers, replaces them, and reschedules them when nodes die.
3. **Easy Rollouts and Rollbacks**: Manage updates to your applications with simple commands and automatically roll back if something goes wrong.
4. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Automatically discovers services and load balances traffic across containers.
5. **Storage Orchestration**: Automatically mounts the storage system of your choice, whether from local storage, a public cloud provider, or a network storage system.

### How Kubernetes Helps:
- **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Ensures that your Docker images can be deployed in a cloud-native manner.
- **System Reliability**: Minimizes the need to worry about patching and crashes as Kubernetes handles auto-healing.
- **Scalability**: Offers easy auto-scaling with simple constructs.
- **Observability**: Provides a comprehensive dashboard for observing the entire system.

### Conclusion

Kubernetes simplifies the management of containerized applications by providing robust features for deployment, scaling, monitoring, and maintenance. It is particularly well-suited for cloud-native applications where high availability, scalability, and efficiency are critical.

The missing word in the statement "Kubernetes is also known as k8s. K_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ s" is "Kubernetes".

The uploaded images illustrate a web application architecture before adopting Kubernetes. Below is an explanation of this architecture based on the images:

### Image 1: Backend Architecture
![Backend Architecture](https://api.website.com/mnt/data/image.png)

1. **Endpoint**: `https://api.website.com`
   - This is the endpoint exposed to users or client applications for accessing backend services.

2. **Load Balancer**:
   - The load balancer receives requests from `https://api.website.com` and distributes them across multiple backend servers to ensure efficient handling and high availability.

3. **Backend EC2 Machines**:
   - **Backend EC2 Machine 1**
   - **Backend EC2 Machine 2**
   - These are EC2 instances running the backend services. The load balancer distributes the incoming requests between these instances.

### Image 2: Frontend Architecture
![Frontend Architecture](https://website.com/mnt/data/image.png)

1. **Endpoint**: `https://website.com`
   - This is the endpoint for the frontend of the application.

2. **Frontend EC2 Machine 1**:
   - This EC2 instance hosts the frontend application, which is built using Next.js.

### Summary of Pre-Kubernetes Architecture

- **Single Point Entry**: Each service (frontend and backend) has a single endpoint (`https://website.com` for the frontend and `https://api.website.com` for the backend).
- **Load Balancer**: The backend services use a load balancer to distribute traffic between multiple EC2 instances.
- **EC2 Instances**: Both frontend and backend services are hosted on EC2 instances, with the backend utilizing multiple instances for load balancing.

### Benefits of Moving to Kubernetes
1. **Scalability**: Kubernetes can automatically scale the number of container instances based on traffic load.
2. **Self-Healing**: Kubernetes automatically restarts failed containers, ensuring high availability.
3. **Deployment Management**: Easier management of application updates and rollbacks.
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Kubernetes efficiently manages resources across the cluster, optimizing the use of CPU and memory.
5. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Built-in mechanisms for service discovery and load balancing.
6. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities integrated within the Kubernetes ecosystem.

Transitioning to Kubernetes would enhance the efficiency, reliability, and scalability of the application by leveraging these advanced features.

### Kubernetes Architecture Overview

#### Nodes

In Kubernetes, a cluster consists of multiple machines (nodes) connected together, each running Kubernetes. Nodes are categorized into two types:

1. **Master Node (Control Plane)**
   - Manages the entire cluster.
   - Deploys and monitors containers.
   - Ensures the system is self-healing.
   - Listens to instructions from developers.

2. **Worker Nodes**
   - Run the actual applications (containers/pods).
   - Handle the application workloads.

#### Master Node (Control Plane) Components

![Master Node Components](https://notion-image-url)

1. **API Server**
   - **Handling RESTful API Requests**: Processes requests from clients (e.g., kubectl, other Kubernetes components, external applications).
     - Creates, reads, updates, and deletes Kubernetes resources (pods, services, deployments).
   - **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensures only authenticated and authorized users/components can perform actions.
     - Validates user credentials and checks access control policies.
   - **Metrics and Health Checks**: Exposes endpoints for monitoring the health and performance of the control plane.
   - **Communication Hub**: Central communication point for the control plane.
     - Interacts with other components (scheduler, controller manager, kubelet) to manage the cluster state.

2. **etcd**
   - A consistent and highly available key-value store for all cluster data.
   - Stores configuration data, state information, and metadata.
   - [etcd Quickstart](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/quickstart/)

3. **kube-scheduler**
   - Monitors for newly created pods with no assigned node.
   - Assigns nodes to these pods based on resource availability and constraints.
   - [Kubernetes Scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/)

4. **kube-controller-manager**
   - Runs a set of controllers that manage the state of the cluster.
   - Ensures the desired state matches the current state by making necessary adjustments.
   - [Kube-Controller-Manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)

   **Examples of Controllers**:
   - **Node Controller**: Detects and responds when nodes go down.
   - **Deployment Controller**: Manages deployments and ensures desired state by creating/updating ReplicaSets.
   - **ReplicaSet Controller**: Ensures the desired number of pod replicas are running, creating/deleting pods as necessary.

### Worker Nodes

Worker nodes are responsible for running the applications. Each worker node contains:

- **Kubelet**: An agent that ensures the containers are running in a pod.
- **Kube-proxy**: A network proxy that runs on each node, maintaining network rules for communication with the pods.
- **Container Runtime**: Software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

### Benefits of Kubernetes

1. **Scalability**: Automatically scales applications based on traffic.
2. **High Availability**: Self-healing capabilities ensure uptime.
3. **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Optimizes resource usage across the cluster.
4. **Simplified Deployment and Management**: Streamlines deployment and management of applications.
5. **Observability and Monitoring**: Integrated tools for monitoring and logging.

### Summary

By adopting Kubernetes, the infrastructure becomes more robust, scalable, and easier to manage. Kubernetes automates many aspects of application deployment and management, providing a powerful platform for running containerized applications.

### Kubernetes Architecture Overview (Continued)

#### Worker Nodes

Worker nodes are responsible for running the actual application workloads, including both backend and frontend services. Each worker node consists of several critical components:

1. **kubelet**

   ![kubelet](https://notion-image-url)

   The kubelet is an essential agent running on each node in the Kubernetes cluster. Its primary responsibilities include:
   
   - **Watch for PodSpecs**: The kubelet monitors the API server for PodSpecs scheduled to run on its node. This involves managing new pods that need to be started, as well as updating or terminating existing pods.
   
   - **Reconcile Desired State**: The kubelet compares the current state of the node (running pods and their statuses) with the desired state as defined by the PodSpecs.
   
   - **Take Action**: To align the actual state with the desired state, the kubelet performs several actions:
     - **Start Pods**: Pulls necessary container images, creates containers, and starts the pods.
     - **Monitor Health**: Conducts health checks (liveness and readiness probes) on running containers. Containers failing health checks may be restarted based on the pod's restart policy.
     - **Update Pods**: Updates running pods in response to changes in PodSpecs (e.g., configuration updates).
     - **Stop Pods**: Terminates and removes containers when pods are no longer needed or must be terminated.
     
   - **Report Status**: Periodically reports the status of pods and the node back to the API server, including resource usage (CPU, memory) and container statuses.

2. **kube-proxy**

   ![kube-proxy](https://notion-image-url)

   The kube-proxy is a network proxy running on each node in the Kubernetes cluster. Its functions include:
   
   - **Network Routing**: Manages network rules for communication between services and pods.
   - **Service Discovery**: Enables communication within the cluster by maintaining network rules and facilitating service discovery.

3. **Container Runtime**

   The container runtime is the software responsible for running containers on a worker node. It interacts with the kubelet to manage the lifecycle of containers as specified by Kubernetes pod specifications.

   Common container runtimes used in Kubernetes include:
   
   - **containerd**: A high-level container runtime designed for simplicity and portability.
   - **CRI-O**: An implementation of the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI) to enable using the Open Container Initiative (OCI) runtime.
   - **Docker**: A popular container runtime used for creating and managing containers.
   
   **Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**: 
   
   The CRI is a plugin interface that allows the kubelet to use various container runtimes without needing to know the specifics of each runtime. This abstraction layer provides flexibility and choice to users by enabling Kubernetes to support multiple container runtimes.

### Summary of Kubernetes Components

- **Nodes**: Machines in the Kubernetes cluster (Master and Worker nodes).
- **Master Node (Control Plane)**: Manages the cluster (API Server, etcd, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager).
- **Worker Nodes**: Run application workloads (kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime).

By leveraging these components, Kubernetes provides a robust and flexible platform for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
