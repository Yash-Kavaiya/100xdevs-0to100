# Document Object Model 
A standard for how to get ,change ,add or delete HTML elements

Javascript makes the HTML page active and dynamic via the DOM

What is DOM

- A programming interface for web documents
- DOM is not a programming language.
- Prepresents the page so that programs can change the docuemnt structure,style and content.

- The DOm is a tree like representation of web page that gets loaded into the browser

- The DOM represents the documents as nodes and objects
- Without it ,the Javascript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages , HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts

- Web API used to build websites

When you create a script ,whether inline a <script> element or included in the web page , you can immediately begin the API for the document or window objects to manipulate the document itself.

The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language ,making the strutural representation of the docuemnt available from a single ,consistent API.
