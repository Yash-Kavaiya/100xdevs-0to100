# Building a Robust Fitness Tracking Backend: Technical Architecture Guide üèóÔ∏è

## Overview üéØ
Let's dive into creating a comprehensive backend architecture for a fitness tracking application, incorporating best practices and modern development approaches.

## Core Architecture Components üîß

### 1. User Authentication & Authorization System üîê
```typescript
// Authentication middleware example
const authMiddleware = async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  try {
    const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
    if (!token) throw new Error('No token provided');
    
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication failed' });
  }
};
```

### 2. Database Schema Design üìä

```sql
-- Core tables structure
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE workouts (
    workout_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(user_id),
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    duration_minutes INTEGER NOT NULL,
    calories_burned INTEGER,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## API Endpoints Structure üõ£Ô∏è

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Status Codes |
|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| `/api/auth/register` | POST | User registration | 201, 400 |
| `/api/auth/login` | POST | User authentication | 200, 401 |
| `/api/workouts` | GET | Fetch user workouts | 200, 404 |
| `/api/workouts` | POST | Log new workout | 201, 400 |

## Edge Case Handling Strategy üõ°Ô∏è

### Input Validation
```javascript
const validateWorkout = (data) => {
  const errors = [];
  
  if (!data.duration || data.duration <= 0) {
    errors.push('Duration must be positive');
  }
  
  if (!['cardio', 'strength', 'flexibility'].includes(data.type)) {
    errors.push('Invalid workout type');
  }
  
  return errors;
};
```

## Deployment Architecture üöÄ

### Blue-Green Deployment Flow
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Production-Blue] --> B[Health Check]
    B --> C{Check Pass?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Switch Traffic]
    C -->|No| E[Rollback]
    D --> F[Production-Green]
```

## Database Selection Guide üíæ

### Recommended Stack
- **Primary DB**: PostgreSQL
  - *Reason*: ACID compliance, complex query support
- **Cache Layer**: Redis
  - *Reason*: Fast retrieval of frequently accessed data
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch
  - *Reason*: Advanced workout search capabilities

## Performance Monitoring üìà

```javascript
// Performance middleware
const performanceMiddleware = async (req, res, next) => {
  const start = process.hrtime();
  
  res.on('finish', () => {
    const [seconds, nanoseconds] = process.hrtime(start);
    const duration = seconds * 1000 + nanoseconds / 1000000;
    
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url} - ${duration}ms`);
  });
  
  next();
};
```

## Error Handling Strategy üîç

### HTTP Status Code Implementation
```typescript
enum HttpStatus {
  OK = 200,
  CREATED = 201,
  BAD_REQUEST = 400,
  UNAUTHORIZED = 401,
  NOT_FOUND = 404,
  INTERNAL_ERROR = 500
}

class ApiResponse {
  static success(data: any) {
    return {
      status: HttpStatus.OK,
      data,
      error: null
    };
  }
  
  static error(status: HttpStatus, message: string) {
    return {
      status,
      data: null,
      error: message
    };
  }
}
```
